# Specktre (Painter Goblin remix)

Specktre modified from Alex Chan's original work [here][s1]. The code has been
modified to output its patterns using original Painter Goblin palettes for
testing their effectiveness and aesthetic.

The original code is MIT licensed and the modifications to that have been minor
i.e. largely around the mechanisms used to output color.

To run simply `python specktre.py` and an image will be output. You'll need to
modify the code to use more sophisticated options from Alex's original code.
